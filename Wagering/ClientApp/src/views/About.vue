            Cryptocurrency is a digital currency operating independently from a central
            system like a bank, government, or business.

            Transactions are quick, secure, and inexpensive.
            What distinguishes cryptocurrency from traditional methods is its ability to create a programmable, digital dollar.

            wagering, etc.

            Stellar is lead by an experienced nonprofit organization
            offering extremely low transaction fees while offering
            quick transfers of money (~5 seconds). Stellar also
            provides smart contract capabilities for handling
            complex payment scenarios.

            have?
          </v-expansion-panel-header>
          <v-expansion-panel-content class="body-1">
            The minimum transaction fee is a flat fee of .00001
            lumen per operation, and that's only to deter spam
            behavior on the network. Compare this with traditional
            methods charging a standard fee of 2.9%+.30 per
            transaction - or even more depending on where you send
            it and how much is sent: Stellar Lumens easily comes out
            on top.

            Wagering.gg offers a modern platform for finding,
            accepting, and handling wagers. Unlike other platforms,
            our service allows users to keep control of their funds
            entirely.

          <v-expansion-panel-content class="body-1">
            Utilizing smart contracts on the Stellar network,
            Wagering.gg can award funds directly between accounts
            and can create complex payment scenarios. Imagine a
            scenario where 100 people enter a tournament with money
            and the top players earn some of the pool. With smart
            contracts, this is possible.

          <v-expansion-panel-content class="body-1">
            Our service fee is 10% - or 5% for verified users - of
            the loser's wager amount. A standard percentage rate
            keeps the process simple and allows for low-value wagers
            to be possible. This still keeps our fees close to
            traditional methods while being able to provide a
            service.
